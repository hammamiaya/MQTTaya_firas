this work is aiming to make a link with th eOSGI and the protocole MQTT
OSGi has a layered model to provide several concepts. Mostly the Bundles and Modules are seen when talking about OSGi, where the focus is on modularization. But the Services layer is at least as interesting as the Bundles and Modules
MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth
